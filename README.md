This repository contains the basic code required to run MRP-based
spatial (SMRP) and spatio-temporal (STMRP) interpolation tasks. 
There are currently two MRP-based interpolation variants for both
tasks: SD-MRP and WP-MRP, which can be either spatial (SMRP) or 
spatio-temporal (STMRP). 
Further functionality will be added as the need for it arises.

Dependencies:

- Numpy             1.19.0
- Networkx          2.4
